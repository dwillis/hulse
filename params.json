{"name":"Hulse","tagline":"Ruby wrapper for House and Senate roll call votes","body":"# Hulse\r\n\r\nHulse is a Ruby gem for accessing House and Senate roll call votes from the official sources on [house.gov](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2013/index.asp) and [senate.gov](http://www.senate.gov/pagelayout/legislative/a_three_sections_with_teasers/votes.htm). It is developed under Ruby 1.9.3.\r\n\r\nHulse has two classes, `HouseVote` and `SenateVote` which create Ruby objects using the XML attributes available from roll call vote data (voice votes are not covered by Hulse or available as data from official sources). Hulse makes a few changes, renaming some attributes for clarity and consistency, and collapsing each House vote's date and time into a single datetime attribute. Otherwise it does not alter the original data.\r\n\r\n`HouseVote` and `SenateVote` have different attributes due to parliamentary conventions and the presence or absence of data in one chamber or the other. Senators are uniquely identified by a `lis_member_id`; House members are uniquely identified by a `bioguide_id` beginning in 2003. Prior to 2003, there is no unique ID for House members, but using a combination of name, state and political party one can be manfactured. House member attributes also include an `unaccented_name` and an `name` attribute that may contain accent characters.\r\n\r\nHulse is named for [Carl Hulse](https://www.nytimes.com/learning/students/ask_reporters/Carl_Hulse.html), a longtime congressional correspondent for The New York Times.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nAdd this line to your application's Gemfile:\r\n\r\n    gem 'hulse'\r\n\r\nAnd then execute:\r\n\r\n    $ bundle\r\n\r\nOr install it yourself as:\r\n\r\n    $ gem install hulse\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nFor both House and Senate votes, pass the year and roll call number into the `find` class method:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n1.9.3-p484> require 'hulse'\r\n1.9.3-p484> include Hulse\r\n1.9.3-p484> hv = HouseVote.find(2013, 628)\r\n1.9.3-p484> hv.question\r\n => \"On Agreeing to the Amendment\"\r\n 1.9.3-p484> hv.vote_count\r\n  => {:yea_total=>157, :nay_total=>258, :present_total=>0, :not_voting_total=>16}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBe aware that in 2012, there were 5 House votes that occurred on Jan. 1, 2013. These are considered \"2012\" votes by [the Clerk of the House](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2012/index.asp), so use 2012 as the year for these.\r\n\r\n## Authors\r\n\r\n* [Derek Willis](https://github.com/dwillis)\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\n1.
